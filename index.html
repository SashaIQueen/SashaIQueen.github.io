<h1> ~Hawaii~ </h1>
<p>Ahola! I will be talking about Hawaii! If your not into Hawaii then this is not your website.So you probably want to leave now.</p>

<p>Before I get into things, let me tell you about how I got so interested in Hawaii.</p>

<p>When I was around about 9, my only dream to travel to was to Hawaii. Hawaii seemed like a peaceful and it still feels like it now. I really want to explore Honolulu, which is the capital city of Hawaii. It also has very nice weather, well atleast I think it does. I use to think that Hawaii had Cocunut Bikinis. Until I asked my friend who lived in Hawaii if Coconut Bikinis were actually a thing. Unfortunatly, she said it's just a myth. If Coconut Bikinis aren't actually a thing, I will make it a thing! Haha! Since Hawaii has the highest tourist rate, it's really expensive to go. Well, for me it is. That's pretty much all about me, wishing to travel to Hawaii.</p>
