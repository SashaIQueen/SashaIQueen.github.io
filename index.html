<h1> ~Hawaii~ </h1>
<p>Aloha! I will be talking about Hawaii! If your not into Hawaii then this is not your website.So you probably want to leave now.</p>

<p>Before I get into things, let me tell you about how I got so interested in Hawaii.</p>

<p>When I was around about 9, my only dream to travel to was to Hawaii. Hawaii seemed like a peaceful and it still feels like it now. I really want to explore Honolulu, which is the capital city of Hawaii. It also has very nice weather, well atleast I think it does. I use to think that Hawaii had Cocunut Bikinis. Until I asked my friend who lived in Hawaii if Coconut Bikinis were actually a thing. Unfortunatly, she said it's just a myth. If Coconut Bikinis aren't actually a thing, I will make it a thing! Haha! Since Hawaii has the highest tourist rate, it's really expensive to go. That's pretty much all about me, wishing to travel to Hawaii. Haha!</p>
  
<h2>Where is Hawaii?</h2>

<p>Hawaii is in the United States region.</p>

<h3>Is Hawaii safe?</h3>

<p>If your wondering about 'is it dangerous animal safe', the answer to that is kinda yes. There are dangerous animals there but you won't see them in a public area but maybe in a quiet area. If your wondering for 'is it dodgy', it's not that dodgy during the day but if your walking alone at night. It will seem a bit dodgy. Always bring a friend with you.
