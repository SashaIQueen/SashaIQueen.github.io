<h3>Is Hawaii safe?</h3>

<p>If your wondering about 'is it dangerous animal safe', the answer to that is kinda yes. There are dangerous animals there but you won't see them in a public area but maybe in a quiet area. If your wondering for 'is it dodgy', it's not that dodgy during the day but if your walking alone at night. It will seem a bit dodgy. Always bring a friend with you.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NfWH0SB5_O8">Honolulu, Hawaii Tour Guide</a></p>
